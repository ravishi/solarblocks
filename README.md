===========

This is some ancient code that was intended to become a Tetris clone for the
Game Boy Advance. In those dark ages I didn't even know VCSs, so this is the
most recent code I found.

It was mostly built around [TONC](http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm),
which as far as I remember is a set of tools, libraries and a book that could
be used to develop things on the GBA.


Building
--------

I promise I'll try to build this by hand later. For now, there's a built bin
that runs on Visual Boy Advance (and probably some other emulators).
